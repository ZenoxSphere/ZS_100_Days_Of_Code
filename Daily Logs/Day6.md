# Day 6 (26/06/2020) - Arrays and updating the Character Generator.
Today I started working through the next chapter on learncpp.com.

I struggled to find the motivation to start today, I think I need to start pacing myself a bit more, The 100 day challenge is a minimum of 1 hour a day and yesterday I covered so much that it took nearly double that time to write my log and although making a large amount of progress in a short amount of time is great, the point of the challenge is to stay consistent.

The tutorials I worked through today covered Arrays, Sorting arrays, Multidimensional arrays, C-style strings and std::stringview. I stopped there as the next part of the chapter covers Pointers and Memory management, which I would like to spend more time to properly focus on it, I also wanted to make a minor update to my Character Generator Program as I was not happy with how I left it yesterday.

The first edit I made to the program was changing the item variables in the character struct to an array and I read forward in the learncpp tutorial to work out how to use for each loops in C++ to make the printing of the characters inventory more efficient.

Finally, I made all of the methods modular so they can be re-used. I did consider creating a menu where the user can re-roll their stats and change what is in their inventory but I didn't in the end as I am trying to keep my code simple while I am using new techniques to improve it.

I am fairly happy with the code now and happy with my update even though it does not add any functionality to the program as the code is far better quality and easier to expand on than before. There are still plenty of improvement that can be made but I would like to come back later when I have learnt more about the language.
