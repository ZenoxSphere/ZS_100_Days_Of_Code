# Day 4 (24/06/2020) - Enums, Structs, Control Flow and the Babylonian Square root Algorithm.
Most of today's learning re-introduced me to things that I have already used before in Java. I covered chapters S and L (these are not numbered due to edits being made on learncpp.com).

Most of the material in Chapter S was already familiar to me (Strings and Enums/Enum classes) what made this chapter even easier was that the way they are written, and work is almost exactly the same as it is in Java. Something new that was introduced to me was Structs, I was very impressed by structs and I can think of many times I could have used them in my Java programs.

Chapter S also included a tutorial on how to use a Language reference, something I have already done with Java and its documentation. The refence used by this tutorial was cppreference.com, I far prefer the Java doc's however as I feel they are much easier to read and find the information I need.

A small problem I had with some of the tutorials I worked through today was that some of the pseudo code shown on the website was not formatted as code on the page, which made it harder to read.

I had come across all of the material covered in Chapter L before and for all of the syntax (not including random number generation) it was the same as Java. This chapter covered if statements, switch statements, loops, and some other basic control flow statements.

The sections on random number generation and input validation were very interesting and a good refresher for me, I was surprised at how inconvenient the standard library solution was for generating random numbers. The standard random number generator in Java is much easier to use. The tutorial also shows a third-party library version of random number generation which is more straightforward.

After working my way through those two chapters I decided to recreate the first algorithm introduced in my algorithm's module at university, The Babylonian Algorithm. This did not take very long, as I simply translated my solution from Java to C++ using the syntax I had learned. My solution is probably not the best way to do it, but it works.

Each day I like to write small programs that use Syntax and techniques that I have picked up from the tutorials; while I was writing todays log I thought of a basic character generator that I could write that would use Enums, Structs, switches and Random number generation, but I am out of time for today so I think I will try and create it tomorrow. The day after tomorrow I have a big chapter to work through, this involves a lot of concepts that are new to me, including pointers and memory management, and it is 25 parts long so may need a couple of days to work through.
