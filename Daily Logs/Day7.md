# Day 7 (29/06/2020) - Pointers and memory management.
After a break over the weekend, today I started to work through the tutorials on pointers and dynamic memory management, which are two concepts that I have not come across before. 

I have secretly been dreading the time where I would have to learn about pointers and memory management as I have heard that they can be tricky concepts to understand, although I was surprised how well I managed to pick up the concepts. The topics I covered today include:

* Pointers
* Null Pointers
* Pointers and Arrays
* Pointer Arithmetic and Array Indexing
* Dynamic Memory Management with New and Delete
* Dynamically allocating Arrays

I have by no means mastered these concepts, but I am very happy with the progress I have made today. I am very impressed by how well the tutorials on learncpp.com explain these topics and will be using it when I need to reference how to use these functions again in the future. A bonus of learncpp.com again is that it is up to date and in this chapter explains C++ 11 concepts such as the `nullptr` keyword.

Another concept that was interesting to me was how pointers in arrays work, especially when they are passed in functions. Learning C++ I a great way of teaching me more about how the computer hardware works corresponding to my code which is something that I enjoy learning more about.

Another thing I enjoy about these tutorials is slowly uncovering concepts and features that I have used before in other languages, today the tutorials noted iterators and other functionality in the algorithms part of the standard library, which appear later in this chapter. 

I have not made any changes to any code today, I did try and create a dynamically sized array today for the inventory portion of my character generator but soon realised that I would need a Vector/ ArrayList style collection, which is luckily featured later on in this chapter under std::vector.

This concludes the first 7 days of my learning, in which I have covered:

* Variables and Datatypes
* Input and Output
* Basic Functions
* Header Files
* Passing parameters
* Operators
* Type convertion
* Arrays
* Pointers
* Memory Management

And a whole lot more! I am very happy with the progress I am making in such short time, especially as I have been able to create some small programs along the way.
