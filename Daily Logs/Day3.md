# Day 3 (23/06/2020) - Operators, Variable scope, duration and linkage, User-defined namespaces and more.
Today I feel I have covered a lot of ground, although it was rather difficult. Most of the content in the tutorial today (chapters 5 and 6) is stuff I have not come across before.

I made my way through chapter 5 quite quickly today as it covers operators, most of this chapter was similar to the operators I have seen already in Java and other languages I have used, but it was a good refresher and I learned about new things such as:

* `std::pow` for handling exponents (powers)
* Prefix increment/decrement (I have only used postfix in Java)
* Conditional operators

The next chapter was optional, and it concerned bit manipulation, I am going to return to this at a later date.

I was very underprepared for chapter 6, most of what was covered in this chapter was new to me, a few of the parts of this chapter took a while for me to understand, I will definitely need to go back to this chapter at some point in the future to reinforce some of the topics. What made working through this chapter worse is that it was very long, I feel that the chapter could easily be broken up into 2 or 3 smaller chunks.

The first 11 parts of this chapter covered:
* Compound statements
* User-defined namespaces
* Local and Global variables
* Variable shadowing
* Internal and External linkage
* Global constants and Inline variables
* Static local variables

I feel like the chapter could easily end there (The 11th part of the chapter is even a summary of the first 10 parts). Most of this was new to me, all except Compound statements and local/global variables.

The last 6 parts of the chapter covered:
* "Using" statements
* Typedefs and type aliases
* The auto keyword
* Implicit and Explicit type conversion
* Unnamed and inline namespaces
All of which was new to me except for type conversion. This last part of the chapter contained easier concepts than the first especially when it came to "using" statements and the auto keyword.

Reading through this chapter showed me how much more depth there is in C++ over Java. Getting through these chapters took me over an hour.

After this I decided to make an edit to the Grade Calculator from yesterday to add a few features covered in chapter 6 and headers/header guards from chapter 2 which is another topic I need to reinforce my knowledge on. Even though this did not add any functionality to the program it helped me learn how to impliment user-defined namespaces and use/create header files in Visual Studio, I added these features by splitting my code across files, which is another thing I hadn't done yet in C++. Editing the files took about 20 minutes.

Looking forward at the next few chapters, I feel like there is more content I will get through rather quickly, this includes strings(which I already bumped into yesterday) and other general syntax such as else if statements and loops of which I previous experience with in other languages before. The next thing to come up that may take some time is pointers. I am hoping after tomorrow I will have enough knowledge to start re-writing some basic algorithms from my university lectures from Java into C++.
