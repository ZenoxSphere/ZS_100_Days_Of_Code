# Day 1 (21/06/2020) - Downloading Git, pushing to Github and "Hello World!"
Today I made a very large amount of progress in learning to write documentation with markdown. I used various resources that can be found on the resources page of this repo to create the README, Log and Resources pages. To create and edit the Markdown files I have been using Notepad++ with the MarkdownViewer++ plugin.

I also downloaded and installed Git for windows and successfully initialised, committed to and pushed my first repository to Github. This was easier to work out that I first thought it would be.

Lastly I downloaded and installed Visual Studio Community 2019 and generated a Hello World program ready for me to start getting into C++ basics tomorrow. I am expecting to cover a large amount of material quickly within the first few days as I am already familiar with OOP and Java. To pickup the basics I will be using the tutorials on learncpp.com.
