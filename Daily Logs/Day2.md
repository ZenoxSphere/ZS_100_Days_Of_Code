# Day 2 (22/06/2020) - Basic Syntax, namespaces, functions and header files
Today I properly started learning C++ using the tutorials from learncpp.com, today I worked my way through to the end of chapter 4. I skipped chapter 3 which concerns debugging as I already know about debugging from my expirence programming in Java.

I found most of my learning today very easy as most of the syntax is very simular to Java. I noted down a few key syntax differences as I went (for example std::cout instead of System.out.print and << over ++ for string concatination). One thing that surprised me about C++ is how easy it was to take inputs, `std::cin` is far easier than Scanner in Java.

I breezed through topics I already knew about from previous programming experience although there were some things that were new to me, these included:
* namespaces
* header files
* the preprocessor
* copy, direct and brace initialisation of variables
* forward declarations

After getting to the end of chapter 4 I decided to write a basic program that converts test scores and prints the grade to the terminal, this was to include most of the things I learned today. I managed this very easy except when it came to using strings.

In Java you have to use a capital letter when initialising Strings, I assumed it was the same in C++ although after trial I had to search how to use them in C++, this involves using a header file. I also had to lookup how they work as return types, which taught me a lesson on namespaces.

I am glad I decided to spend so much time learning git/github and markdown yesterday as it made editing my log and pushing to github very easy today, the next time I will need to learn more about git will be if i need to roll-back changes or clone the repo to my laptop.
