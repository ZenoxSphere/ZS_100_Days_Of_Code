# Daily Log
This is the daily log where I will post about what I do on each day and how many hours I have put into the challenge.

I have created my logs in separate files so each individual log is easier to find.

* [Day 3](https://github.com/ZenoxSphere/ZS_100_Days_Of_Code/blob/master/Daily%20Logs/Day3.md#day-3) Operators, Variable scope, duration and linkage, User defined namespaces and more.
