### What is the 100 days of code challenge?
The 100 days of code challenge is a daily programming challenge in which I will code for atleast an hour everyday for 100 days.

This challenge was originally started by [Alex Kallaway](https://github.com/kallaway).
### Why am I doing the challenge?
I am a Computer Science student and I have just finished my first year at The University of Kent School of Computing, where I have mainly been studying OOP using Java.

Since the start of the Covid-19 Lockdown and the end of my first year of university I feel that I havent achieved anything with my extra free time.
Recently I have wanted to start learning C++ as I feel it will be useful in my CS career and in my video game development hobby and I am using this challenge as motivation to get started.

I have also thinking about learning how to use Git and Github and this challenge is the perfect time to learn them and markdown as an extension of that.
### My Goals
By the end of the challenge I aim to...

* Know the basics of C++ so I can start writing programs
* Create a couple of basic text based games using C++
* Start working on a GUI based game project using SDL
* Gain good knowledge on how to use Git, Github and Markdown
### Music?
I am very into music, especially metal music, this does not concern programming but I listen to music 90% of the time while working at home and I feel it may be interesting if I log what I am listening to in my daily logs, most of the time it will be one of my playlists but if I am listening to anything in particular I will note it down.
